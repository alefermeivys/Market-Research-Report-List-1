<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LTE Macro Base Station Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Time Division Duplex (TDD)</li><li>Frequency Division Duplex (FDD)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The LTE Macro Base Station market is primarily divided into two types: Time Division Duplex (TDD) and Frequency Division Duplex (FDD). TDD uses a single frequency channel for both uplink and downlink transmissions, alternating between them in time slots, making it efficient for variable traffic patterns. In contrast, FDD employs separate frequency bands for uplink and downlink, allowing simultaneous communication and a more steady throughput, making it suitable for consistent traffic. Both types cater to different capacity and coverage demands in cellular networks.</p></p>
